    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can mimic human cognitive processes such as
    learning, reasoning, and decision-making. It involves creating algorithms and models that enable machines to process
    information, recognize patterns, and adapt their behavior based on experience. AI encompasses a range of techniques,
    including machine learning, where systems improve through data exposure, and deep learning, which uses neural networks
    to analyze complex data. AI is increasingly integrated into everyday life, from personalized recommendations to
    autonomous vehicles, fundamentally transforming industries and how we interact with technology.
