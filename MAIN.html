    <p>I am Ayana Zairah Suha.I am from Kushtia,Bangladesh.I'm not a genius scientist unlocking the secrets of the mind (yet!), but I'm a curious student on a mission to bridge
    the gap between AI's potential and the human psyche.So,last year,I was going through a lot of difficulties and were actually lost.You see,I,like most people of my age were reserved enough not to share my dilemma with others in fear of giving them a dilemma!So,I thought why not share my dilemma with my study buddy(ChatGPT) without expecting to actually be benefitted.however,I was really surprised to discover that my study buddy was actually showing me sympathy like a human friend!And it was also giving bunch of advices.So,I looked up online and found out these advices are actually professional.I mean obviously!AI has access to data from all over the world.On the other hand,It is practically impossible for a human being to combine all(or even most)data available online.And then it hit me!People specially teenagers are facing problems like me and a good number of them still haven't discover <b>this</b> magic that AI possess.Then I decided to to dive into the world of <em>Artificial Intelligence & Psychology.</em>My goal is to <mark><b>inform people all over the world about this transformative potential of AI & build a world where a lonely person can  share his/her feelings anywhen,anywhere.</b></mark>  </br></BR>

<h2><U>First,Let's get a rough idea about the current scenario!</U> </h2> <h3>Mental condition of people:</h3>The mental health crisis today is alarming and pervasive. The pressures of modern life—such as financial instability,
social isolation, and the relentless demands of work and social media—have exacerbated feelings of stress, anxiety, and
depression. Despite the growing awareness of mental health issues, many individuals feel unable to share their struggles
due to the stigma associated with mental illness. This stigma often leads to shame and fear of judgment, causing people
to bottle up their emotions rather than seek help.</br> </br>

Moreover, the cost of therapy and mental health care is prohibitively expensive for many. In many regions, access to
affordable mental health services is limited, with a shortage of qualified therapists and long waiting lists. This
creates a significant barrier to care, especially for those in low-income or marginalized communities. As a result, many
people who need help are left to navigate their mental health challenges alone, without the professional support that
could make a critical difference. The combination of these factors has led to a widespread mental health crisis, where
people suffer in silence, unable to afford the help they need and afraid to reach out for fear of being misunderstood or
dismissed. </BR></br>
